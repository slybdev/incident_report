# Incident Report Template & Sample Logs

This repository provides a **ready-to-use Incident Report template** along with **10 realistic sample logs** for practising SOC incident documentation.
Whether youâ€™re learning incident response, threat hunting, or SOC workflows, this resource helps you write **clear, structured, and professional incident reports**.

---

## ðŸ“„ Incident Report Template

You can copy this template for your reports:

```
Incident Report: [Incident Title]
Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
Time Detected: [HH:MM Timezone]
Analyst: [Analyst Name]
System: [System/Host Name]
Case ID: [Case ID]

Summary
On [DD/MM/YYYY] at [HH:MM Timezone], [brief description of incident] was detected on [system/host]. This suggests a potential [threat type].

Detection
Detected by: [tool or method, e.g., SIEM, EDR, or user report]  
Details: [key event details, e.g., alert type or log entry]

Investigation
Findings: [what was found, e.g., suspicious process, IP, or user activity]  
Impact: [what happened, e.g., blocked attempt or data accessed]  
Scope: [affected systems or spread, e.g., single host or network-wide]

Actions Taken
[Action 1, e.g., isolated system]  
[Action 2, e.g., blocked IP or updated firewall]  
[Action 3, e.g., created case in tracking system]

Recommendations
[Next step, e.g., scan system or reset passwords]  
[Prevention, e.g., patch system or train users]

Status
[Status, e.g., Open or Resolved]
```

## ðŸ’¡ How to Practise

1. Pick a log from the sample set.
2. Fill in the Incident Report template for that log.
3. Use the **Event ID mapping table** to guide your analysis and suggested response.
4. Repeat with multiple logs to simulate real SOC incident scenarios.

> Practising consistently will help you **document incidents clearly, professionally, and efficiently**, just like a real SOC analyst.
